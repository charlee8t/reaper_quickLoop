# Reaper quickLoop macro

A macro I made for quick looping sounds creation in Reaper. I use it all the time when working on ambiences, pads, etc.

## Usage

1. Download the zip file and import the ReaperKeyMap file from the Action List menu in Reaper. There you can assign a shortcut to it, or a toolbar button.
2. Add the sound you want to loop into a track, then make a time selection that leaves some of the sound outside of it in both ends.
3. Making sure the track where the sound is is selected, place the edit cursor somewhere inside the time selection, and run the macro.
4. Adjust the crossfade to make sure it sounds good.
5. If everything went fine, you should have a looping sound ready to export. You can delete the extra items from the left and right of the time selection.
